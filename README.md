# μDCN: High-Performance, ML-Orchestrated Data-Centric Networking Architecture

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

μDCN is a high-performance, ML-orchestrated Data-Centric Networking Architecture designed for edge environments. It addresses performance limitations in traditional Python-based Named Data Networking (NDN) implementations by integrating:

- **eBPF/XDP Kernel-Level Packet Handling**: Zero-copy packet parsing for maximum throughput
- **Rust-Based NDN Transport Layer**: Safe, efficient networking with QUIC-based fragmentation
- **Python Control Plane**: Intelligent network orchestration with TensorFlow Lite-based ML models
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Deployment automation and scaling for edge environments

## Architecture

![μDCN Architecture](docs/architecture.md)

The μDCN architecture consists of the following components:

1. **eBPF/XDP Fast Path**: Kernel-level packet processing for line-rate performance
2. **Rust NDN Transport Core**: High-performance, memory-safe implementation of NDN primitives with QUIC transport
3. **ML-Orchestration Layer**: Dynamic network parameter tuning using TensorFlow Lite models
4. **Metrics and Telemetry**: Prometheus integration for real-time performance monitoring

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Linux kernel 5.10+ with eBPF/XDP support
- Rust 1.65+
- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Kubernetes
- TRex packet generator (for testing)

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ben-mansor/muDCN.git
cd udcn
```

2. Build the components
```bash
make build
```

3. Deploy on a local Kubernetes cluster
```bash
make deploy
```

4. Run performance tests
```bash
make test
```

## Performance Highlights

- **Throughput**: Up to 100Gbps packet processing on commodity hardware
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond content retrieval in edge environments
- **Efficiency**: Significant reduction in CPU and memory usage compared to Python-NDN
